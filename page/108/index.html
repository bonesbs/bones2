The human heart has 4 valves. The mitral valve is a complex anatomical structure whose physiological functioning relies on the biomechanical properties and structural . The mitral valve is located in the left side of the heart, between the left atrium and left ventricle. Guarding the inlet to the left ventricle, the mitral valve prevents backflow to the left atrium during ventricular systole. The parasternal two chamber plane (p2) passes through the middle of both . The mitral valve is a flap of tissue that sits in the left side of the heart, between the left atrium and the left ventricle. The normal mitral valve is a dynamic structure that permits blood to flow from the left atrial (la) to left ventricle (lv) during diastole . This means the system takes compressed air and uses it to control energy as it moves through the system.</p>
    <p>The mitral valve is also called a bicuspid valve and plays an important role in your heart. The mitral valve connects the left atrium (la) and the left ventricle (lv). The mitral valve is a complex anatomical structure whose physiological functioning relies on the biomechanical properties and structural . The diagram shows the planes of longitudinal sections through the mitral valve.

Here’s more information about the heart’s mitral valve, its function and some of the diseases that affect the mitral valve. The mitral valve also known as the bicuspid valve or left atrioventricular valve, is one of the four heart valves.
