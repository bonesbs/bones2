        <p>We outline what a transplant is like for most people, and discuss some of the issues that come with it. The fate of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (hspcs) is regulated by their interaction with stromal cells in the bone marrow. The bone marrow stroma consists of a heterogeneous population of cells that provide the structural and physiological support for hematopoietic cells.</p>
